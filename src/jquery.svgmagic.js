/**
 * Replaces matched SVG images in HTML 'img' elements (and optionally CSS background-image properties) with PNG
 * replacement images, generated by a remote server/service API.
 * 
 * -------
 * Options
 * -------
 * * temporaryHoldingImage    [string] This is a URI to an image which will be used as a "holding" image for the SVG
 *                            replacements until the URI of the appropriate PNG replacement has been retrieved from the
 *                            remote server. If set to null (the default behaviour) then no holding image will be used.
 * 
 * * forceReplacements        [boolean] If set to true then SVGMagic will replace SVG images even when the web browser
 *                            reports that it has native SVG support. If set to false (the default behaviour) then
 *                            replacement will only be performed when the web browser does not natively support SVG
 *                            images.
 * 
 * * handleBackgroundImages   [boolean] If set to true then SVGMagic will inspect the CSS background-image property of
 *                            matched elements.  If the background image is an SVG then replacement will additionally
 *                            be performed upon the background image.  If set to false (the default behaviour) then no
 *                            attempt will be made to detect and replace CSS background images.
 * 
 *                            Note that even when this option is enabled, background images are only detected on matched
 *                            elements.  No DOM search is performed to discover background images on (for example) child
 *                            nodes.
 * 
 * * additionalRequestData    [object] This is an object representing key/value pairs of information to send to the
 *                            remote server as part of the request.  The default is an empty object (resulting in no
 *                            additional data being sent).
 * 
 *                            This option is affected by the deprecated options 'secure' and 'dumpcache'.  Presently,
 *                            in order to preserve backwards-compatibility, the keys 'secure' and 'dumpcache' will
 *                            be added to the request data if they are not already present.  The values of these keys
 *                            will contain the respective values of those deprecated options.
 * 
 *                            Additionally, the key 'svgsources' is reserved and will always be overwritten with an
 *                            array of the URIs to the SVG images to be replaced. For this reason, the key 'svgsources'
 *                            must not be used within the additional request data.
 * 
 * * postReplacementCallback  [function(replacedImages)] This is a callback function which is executed after all of the
 *                            image replacement URIs have been retrieved from the remote server and the replacements
 *                            have been performed.
 * 
 *                            The parameter passed to this callback is a JavaScript array of objects which have the
 *                            following structure:
 *                            {
 *                              element             [object] A reference to the jQuery element node upon which the image
 *                                                  replacement has been performed.
 * 
 *                              isBackground        [boolean] True if the the replacement was made upon a CSS
 *                                                  background-image.  Otherwise this is an HTML 'img' element.
 * 
 *                              originalUri         [string] The original URI of the SVG image which has been replaced.
 * 
 *                              replacementUri      [string] The URI of the PNG replacement image.
 *                            }
 * 
 * * remoteServerUri          [string] This is the URI to the remote server API endpoint which converts SVG images into
 *                            PNGs and returns the list of URIs to those PNG replacements.  It is set by default to:
 *                            http://svgmagic.bitlabs.nl/converter.php
 * 
 *                            If you wish to host your own image-conversion server script/service then replace this with
 *                            the URI of your own API endpoint.
 * 
 * * remoteRequestType        [string] This is the type of HTTP request which will be used to communicate with the
 *                            remote server/service endpoint. By default this is set to 'POST'. Be careful if hosting
 *                            a service which accepts HTTP GET requests, as it could be vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
 * 
 * * remoteDataType           [string] This is the data-type sent to and received from the remote server.  By default
 *                            this is set to 'json'.
 * 
 * * replacementUriCreator    [function(jQueryElement, originalUri, isBackground)] If provided, this option alters the
 *                            behaviour of SVGMagic, short-cutting out the initial call to the remote server, to
 *                            retrieve the URIs to the replacement PNG images.  This is suitable for use in specialised
 *                            scenarios when the creation of the URI for the PNG replacements may be accomplished
 *                            entirely in JavaScript.  The server hosting those replacement PNG images must also be
 *                            capable of serving the correct image with only a single GET URI (as the server will not
 *                            have been pre-notified of the path to the SVG source file).  As such, it is most likely to
 *                            be used in hosted applications on a single domain, in which server-side logic has been
 *                            created to serve pre-ordained PNG replacement images.
 * 
 *                            The parameters which this function receives are:
 *                            * [object] A reference to the jQuery object representing the HTML node on which the
 *                              replacement is to be made.
 *                            * [string] The URI of the original SVG image to be replaced.
 *                            * [boolean] True if the replacement is a CSS background-image, false if it is an HTML
 *                              image element.
 * 
 *                            The function (if present) must return a string.  This string indicates the URI to the
 *                            PNG replacement image.  If null is returned then the replacement is skipped and the
 *                            original SVG image is left in-place.
 * 
 *                            The default behaviour (in which this function is null/not-provided) uses a call to a
 *                            remote server/API endpoint containing a list of the URIs of the SVG images to be replaced,
 *                            The response is parsed for the URIs of the replacement PNG images. 
 * 
 * ------------------
 * Deprecated options
 * ------------------
 * * preloader                [string or boolean] This is the URI to an image file which is used as a "holding" image
 *                            for your SVG images while the PNG replacements load from the remote server.  If set to
 *                            boolean false (the default behaviour) then no such holding image is used.
 * 
 *                            DEPRECATED: Use 'temporaryHoldingImage' instead.  If 'temporaryHoldingImage' is set then
 *                            this option is ignored.
 * 
 * * testmode                 [boolean] If set to true then the SVG replacement will be forced on all browsers,
 *                            including those which report that they support SVG natively.  If set to false (the default
 *                            behaviour) then the SVG replacement will only be performed upon browsers which do not
 *                            support it natively.
 * 
 *                            DEPRECATED: Use 'forceReplacements' instead.
 * 
 * * secure                   [boolean] The value (true or false) of this option is passed to the remote SVG replacement
 *                            server as part of the HTTP POST parameters.  Whilst the server may honour it or not, it is
 *                            intended that if the value is true, then the remote server will return a series of HTTPS
 *                            URIs (for the PNG replacement images). If set to false (the default behaviour) then the
 *                            remote server should return HTTP (non-secured) URIs.
 * 
 *                            Regardless of the setting of this option - the initial call to the remote server will be
 *                            performed via unsecured HTTP.
 * 
 *                            DEPRECATED: Use 'additionalRequestData' instead, adding data which the server will
 *                            interpret in order to serve HTTPS image URIs.  The value of this option will be appended
 *                            to the additional request data before it is sent to the server.
 * 
 * * callback                 [function()] An optional callback function which executes once all of the PNG replacement
 *                            image URIs have been retrieved from the remote server and all of the SVG images have had
 *                            their URIs replaced.  This is not quite a callback which executes after the replacement
 *                            images have loaded.  If the value is set to false (the default behaviour) then no
 *                            additional callback is executed.  No parameters are passed to this callback.
 * 
 *                            DEPRECATED: Use 'postReplacementCallback' instead.  If 'postReplacementCallback' is set
 *                            then this option is ignored.
 * 
 * * backgroundimage          [boolean] If set to true then additional inspection will be performed upon all matched
 *                            elements in order to find a CSS background-image property.  If such a property is found
 *                            then it will be included in the replacement process.  If set to false (the default
 *                            behaviour) then no additional work will be performed to find background-images which are
 *                            SVG.
 * 
 *                            DEPRECATED: Use 'handleBackgroundImages' instead.
 * 
 * * dumpcache                [boolean] The value (true or false) of this option is passed to the remote SVG replacement
 *                            server as part of the HTTP POST parameters.  If set to true, then the server is requested
 *                            to clear any cached PNG copy of the replaced SVG image.  This will result in the remote
 *                            server re-generating the PNG replacement.  If set to false (the default behaviour) then
 *                            the remote server is expected to serve cached PNG replacement images where possible. 
 * 
 *                            DEPRECATED: Use 'additionalRequestData' instead, adding data which the server will
 *                            interpret as a request to drop its cache.  The value of this option will be appended
 *                            to the additional request data before it is sent to the server.
